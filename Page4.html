      <p>
        From TMDb - IMDb visualisation, it is discovered that TMDb users are not
        giving low points particularly for highly profitable movies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although, TMDb users rate lower for the highly profitable movies, they
        also rate lower for mid and lowly profitable movies too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing with IMDb users, on average for every category of
        profitability and genre, TMDb users give lower ratings. Using sliders
        and checkboxes in TMDb - IMDb visualisation filtering in terms of genre,
        profit and rating can be achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effective usage of these filtering clearly show that TMDb users are more
        likely to give lower ratings for all categories and all profit levels of
        movies. One can conclude from this results that TMDb users have higher
        standards hence, they are giving lower ratings.
