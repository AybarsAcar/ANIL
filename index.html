            <h1>Clooser Look to Movie Database Platforms and Movie Genres </h1>
            <p>IMDb and TMDb are 2 different movie databases platforms where one can easily access a lot of information about 
                <br>hundreds of thousands of movies. It may sound very similar with each other but in some sense they are not. 
            </p> 
            
            <p>Motivation behind TMDb - IMDb visualisation is to observe effect of conflict between 2 different movie databases 
                <br>on its user profiles. One of them is IMDb (Internet Movie Database) which is currently the most popular movie 
                <br>database platform and the other one is TMDb (The Movie Database). The main difference between these 2 platforms
                <br>is IMDb is a for-profit organisation whereas TMDb is a non-for-profit one. This contrast can easily create 
                <br>a difference between the profiles of users and TMDb - IMDb visualisation aims to reveal that difference using 
                <br>user ratings and metadata about the movies.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Another point is to uncover the relationship between countries and movie genres that these countries are most likely
            <br>to profit from. Every country has its own culture and accordingly own way of creating art. By examining this 
            <br>relationship, Country - Genre visualisation aims to reveal which countries are more likely to profit from which 
            <br>genres of movies and is there any observable relationship between geographic location of countries 
            <br>and the movie genres that these countries are likely to profit from.
            </p>
